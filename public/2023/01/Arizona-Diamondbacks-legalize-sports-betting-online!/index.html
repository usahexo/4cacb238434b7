      		<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-legalize-sports-betting-online"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-legalize-sports-betting-online" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks legalize sports betting online!"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks legalize sports betting online!</h1><p>In a move that could set the stage for other states to follow, the Arizona Diamondbacks have become the first professional sports team in the country to legalize sports betting. The team has partnered with gambling giant MGM to provide an online betting platform for its fans.</p>
<p>Beginning Wednesday, Arizona Diamondback fans will be able to log in to the team’s website and bet on games using MGM’s software. The platform will offer in-game betting, as well as pre-game bets on matchups and futures bets on the outcome of the season.</p>
<p>While many other teams are believed to be considering similar partnerships, the Arizona Diamondbacks are thought to be the first major pro team to go into business with a gambling company.</p>
<p>The decision comes as a result of last month’s Supreme Court ruling which struck down a federal law banning most sports gambling. That ruling cleared the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have begun moving forward with legislation to allow sports betting, including New Jersey, where MGM is based. Pennsylvania and West Virginia are also among the states that have moved quickly to pass legislation regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>In a statement announcing the partnership, Diamondbacks President Derrick Hall said “We’re excited to offer our fans this new opportunity and believe it will add another layer of excitement to our games.”</p>
<p>MGM CEO Jim Murren added that his company is “thrilled” to partner with the Diamondbacks and called it a “watershed moment” for both gaming and sports industries.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-join-the-list-of-states-enabling-sports-betting"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-join-the-list-of-states-enabling-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks join the list of states enabling sports betting!"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks join the list of states enabling sports betting!</h1><p>After the US Supreme Court ruled to repeal the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, states have been scrambling to legalize sports betting. On July 11, Arizona became the latest state to do so when its governor signed a bill into law.</p>
<p>Arizona is now the eighth state to allow sports betting, joining Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. More are likely to follow; Rhode Island and Connecticut are both considering bills to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks were one of several teams to voice support for the legalization of sports betting. “We’re in favor of it,” D-backs president Derrick Hall said in May. “We think it’s something that can be done safely and comparably.”</p>
<p>While Hall acknowledged that there could be some negative consequences from legalized sports betting – such as an increase in game-fixing – he believes they will be outweighed by the positives. “I think it creates more fan interest, more gambling interest,” he said. “It will put more money in the players’ pockets.”</p>
<p>Others share Hall’s view. “Legalized gambling has always been a part of sport, especially in Europe,” said former NBA coach Phil Jackson last month. “It should be legalized here and provide another revenue stream for all professional leagues.”</p>
<p>The repeal of PASPA opens up a $150 billion market for sports betting, according to one estimate. With states eager to get a piece of that pie, expect more and more of them to legalize sports betting in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-partner-with-state-to-enable-sports-betting-online"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-partner-with-state-to-enable-sports-betting-online" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks partner with state to enable sports betting online!"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks partner with state to enable sports betting online!</h1><p>Arizona Diamondbacks partner with state to enable sports betting online!</p>
<p>The Arizona Diamondbacks have partnered with the state of Arizona in order to allow for sports betting online. The state of Arizona has long been interested in legalizing sports betting, and the Diamondbacks are the first professional team to get on board with this new venture.</p>
<p>“We are happy to partner with the state and look forward to working together on this new endeavor that will bring more fan excitement and engagement to our games,” said Derrick Hall, CEO of the Diamondbacks.</p>
<p>This move is seen as a major victory for the Diamondbacks, as it will help increase fan engagement and bring in additional revenue. It is also seen as a major victory for the state of Arizona, as it will help generate much-needed tax revenue. In addition, it is hoped that this move will help reduce illegal gambling activity in the state.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks join a number of other professional sports teams that have already partnered with states in order to allow for sports betting online. These teams include the New Jersey Devils, the Houston Rockets, and the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-are-the-latest-team-to-enable-sports-betting"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-are-the-latest-team-to-enable-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks are the latest team to enable sports betting!"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks are the latest team to enable sports betting!</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Diamondbacks announced that they have partnered with a new sports betting company, MGM Resorts International. As part of the agreement, MGM will become the exclusive gaming partner of the Diamondbacks, as well as their spring training home at Salt River Fields. This partnership comes in the wake of last month’s Supreme Court decision to legalize sports betting throughout the US.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with MGM Resorts and provide our fans with an industry-leading sports betting experience,” said D-backs President and CEO Derrick Hall. “Our team is committed to providing world-class customer service and this partnership will allow us to take our fan engagement to another level.”</p>
<p>MGM already has similar partnerships in place with the likes of the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. This move gives them a foothold in the Arizona market, where they hope to attract customers from both sides of the border. The Diamondbacks’ deal with MGM is also said to include promotional opportunities and interactive content for fans.</p>
<p>This news comes just days after Major League Baseball announced its own partnership with gambling company DraftKings. That agreement gives DraftKings exclusive rights to offer online and mobile bets on all MLB games, as well as certain international games. It will also allow DraftKings users to accumulate points that can be redeemed for experiences like meet-and-greets with players or front row seats at games.</p>
<p>With states now able to legalize sports betting as they see fit, we can expect many more such deals between teams and gaming companies in the months and years ahead. This is a major shift for American sports, which have long been wary of any connection with gambling institutions. But now that gambling is officially legal, teams are scrambling to get a piece of the lucrative pie.</p>

<p>Since then, a handful of states have passed legislation permitting some form of online sports betting. Here’s a look at which states enable sports betting online Arizona Diamondbacks:</p>
<p>Alaska</p>
<p>Arkansas</p>
<p>Colorado<br> Iowa<br>Kansas<br>Montana New Hampshire<br>New Mexico<br>North Dakota  Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Dakota Tennessee Vermont West Virginia Wyoming</p>
