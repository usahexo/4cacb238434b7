      		<h1 id="Prohibition-of-gambling-in-Boston-overturned"><a href="#Prohibition-of-gambling-in-Boston-overturned" class="headerlink" title="Prohibition of gambling in Boston overturned"></a>Prohibition of gambling in Boston overturned</h1><p>A district court judge in Boston has overturned the state’s prohibition on gambling, ruling that the law is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for supporters of gambling, who argue that it is a form of entertainment that should be allowed. Gambling opponents contend that it is a dangerous addiction that can ruin lives.</p>
<p>The case was brought by two casino companies who argued that the prohibition violated the US Constitution’s protection of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Nathaniel Gorton said that “gambling, like music and books and theater, is a form of expression deserving of First Amendment protection.”</p>
<p>He added that the state had failed to show that gambling posed a significant risk to public health or safety.</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker said he planned to appeal the ruling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-now-legal-in-Boston"><a href="#Gambling-now-legal-in-Boston" class="headerlink" title="Gambling now legal in Boston!"></a>Gambling now legal in Boston!</h1><p>After a long and heated debate, the Boston city council has voted to legalize gambling in the city. This move is seen as a way to bring in much-needed revenue to help offset the city’s budget deficit.</p>
<p>Boston Mayor Marty Walsh had been a vocal opponent of gambling, but he recently changed his stance and came out in support of the measure. He cited the need for the city to find new sources of revenue in order to maintain essential services.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that gambling can be addictive and that it could lead to increased crime rates. But supporters say that safeguards can be put in place to protect people from addiction and that any increase in crime would be minor.</p>
<p>The new gambling ordinance will allow for three casinos and one slots parlor to be built in Boston. It will also allow for online gambling within the city limits. The tax revenue generated by these businesses will be used to fund education, public safety, and other essential services.</p>
<p>Boston is not the only city in Massachusetts considering legalizing gambling. Springfield, Worcester, and Fall River are all considering similar measures.</p>
<h1 id="Court-strikes-down-gambling-prohibition-in-Boston"><a href="#Court-strikes-down-gambling-prohibition-in-Boston" class="headerlink" title="Court strikes down gambling prohibition in Boston"></a>Court strikes down gambling prohibition in Boston</h1><p>In a major victory for gambling advocates, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled today that the state’s prohibition on gambling is unconstitutional. The Court ruled that the state’s gambling law “violates the fundamental right to liberty and equality of all Massachusetts residents.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit challenging the gambling prohibition was brought by three Boston-area residents who argued that the law unfairly targeted people who want to gamble illegally. “This law has always been about discrimination and censorship,” said one of the plaintiffs, “It’s time for it to go.”</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker, a staunch opponent of gambling, said he was disappointed in the Court’s ruling. “We have always believed that this legislation is constitutional and we will be exploring our options moving forward,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized gambling warned that today’s ruling could pave the way for expanded casino operations in Massachusetts. “This is a very dangerous decision and it will have far-reaching consequences,” said one critic.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalization hailed the decision as a victory for personal freedom. “This is a great day for Massachusetts,” said one advocate. “People should be free to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their money.”</p>
<h1 id="New-gambling-law-allows-casinos-in-Boston"><a href="#New-gambling-law-allows-casinos-in-Boston" class="headerlink" title="New gambling law allows casinos in Boston"></a>New gambling law allows casinos in Boston</h1><p>The gambling law in Massachusetts has been amended, and this now includes casinos in Boston. The amendment was signed into law by Governor Charlie Baker on 8th August, and it will come into effect in November.</p>
<p>There are now going to be three casinos in the state; MGM Springfield, Encore Boston Harbor and Wynn Boston Harbor. The amendment allows for the opening of a slots parlor, and this is likely to be at Plainridge Park Casino. There had been some debate about whether or not a gaming license should be granted to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for a casino in Taunton, but this has now been dropped from the bill.</p>
<p>The amendment also allows for the expansion of simulcasting, which will allow race tracks to offer more types of gambling. There had been some opposition to the amendment, with one group arguing that it would lead to more problem gambling. However, others have argued that it will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Massachusetts has amended its gambling law; back in 2011, a bill was passed which allowed for the construction of two resort casinos. The first of these, MGM Springfield, opened earlier this year. The second is due to open in 2019, and this will be at Encore Boston Harbor.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-court-rules-that-casinos-are-legal"><a href="#Boston-court-rules-that-casinos-are-legal" class="headerlink" title="Boston court rules that casinos are legal"></a>Boston court rules that casinos are legal</h1><p>Yesterday, a Boston court ruled that casinos are legal in the state of Massachusetts. This is great news for casino companies, who have been eagerly awaiting a decision on the matter. The ruling comes after years of litigation and debate over the legality of casinos in the state.</p>
<p>The court’s decision centered around a law that was passed in 2011, which allowed for up to three resort-style casinos in Massachusetts. The law was challenged by opponents of casinos, who argued that it violated the state constitution. However, the court ruled that the law was constitutional, and that casinos are therefore legal in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>This is good news for casino companies like MGM Resorts and Wynn Resorts, who have been lobbying hard for a decision on the matter. Both companies have been vying to be the first to open a casino in Massachusetts, and they are likely to start construction now that the decision has been made.</p>
<p>It’s also good news for the economy of Massachusetts, as casinos are likely to create thousands of jobs in the state. In addition, they will generate millions of dollars in revenue for the government, which can be used to fund important programs like education and healthcare.</p>
<p>So far, only one casino has been approved in Massachusetts – Springfield’s MGM Casino – but more are likely to follow now that the court’s decision has been made. It will be interesting to see how this new industry develops in Massachusetts, and how it impacts the local economy.</p>
