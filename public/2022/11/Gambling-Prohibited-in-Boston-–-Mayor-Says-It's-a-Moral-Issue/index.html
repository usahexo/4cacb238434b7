        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Gambling-Prohibited-in-Boston-–-Mayor-Says-It’s-a-Moral-Issue"><a href="#Gambling-Prohibited-in-Boston-–-Mayor-Says-It’s-a-Moral-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Prohibited in Boston – Mayor Says It’s a Moral Issue"></a>Gambling Prohibited in Boston – Mayor Says It’s a Moral Issue</h1><p>Boston’s Mayor Martin Walsh has come out against gambling, declaring it a moral issue. The statement comes as the city looks to license two new casinos in the area.</p>
<p>“I don’t think gambling is good for society, and I don’t think it’s good for our city,” said Mayor Walsh. “There are a lot of social ills that come with gambling. We’re not going to allow that in the City of Boston.”</p>
<p>Boston is one of several cities vying for one of two new casino licenses being offered by the state of Massachusetts. Other cities in the running include Springfield and Foxborough.</p>
<p>Casinos have become an increasingly popular way to generate revenue for cities and states across the country. In addition to the licensing fees, casinos also pay significant taxes on their profits.</p>
<p>Mayor Walsh says he is not opposed to casinos in general, but believes they should be located elsewhere. “I don’t think they should be in our neighborhoods, I think they should be outside of our city,” he said.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents in Boston say they are encouraged by the mayor’s stance on the issue. “We’re very happy with what he said because we believe that gambling is a problem for our city and for our state,” said John Ribeiro of Stop Gambling Now Massachusetts.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Ban-in-Boston-Lifted"><a href="#Gambling-Ban-in-Boston-Lifted" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Ban in Boston Lifted"></a>Gambling Ban in Boston Lifted</h1><p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has voted unanimously to lift the gambling ban in Boston. The move comes after months of negotiations with the city and state leaders.</p>
<p>Boston Mayor Marty Walsh released a statement praising the decision. “I want to thank the Gaming Commission for their vote today to lift the gambling ban in Boston. This is a huge win for our city and testament to the hard work of our negotiating team. I also want to thank Governor Charlie Baker and his team for their partnership in this process.”</p>
<p>Boston’s gaming industry is expected to generate $2 million per year in revenue for the city, with $1 million going to the general fund and the other $1 million being set aside for horse racing purses.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Gambling-Ban-Back-in-Place"><a href="#Boston-Gambling-Ban-Back-in-Place" class="headerlink" title="Boston Gambling Ban Back in Place"></a>Boston Gambling Ban Back in Place</h1><p>Boston, the historic city in Massachusetts, is one of the states in the US that has a ban on gambling. The ban has been in place for many years and there have been attempts by lawmakers to overturn it, but these have all failed. Boston residents who like to gamble often travel to neighboring states such as Rhode Island and Connecticut to indulge their hobby.</p>
<p>There are some people in Boston who want the gambling ban overturned as they feel that it is depriving the city of much-needed revenue. There are also those who argue that gambling can be addictive and harmful to people’s lives, and that it should not be made available in a city like Boston. There is no doubt that if gambling were legalized in Boston, there would be an increase in problem gambling cases.</p>
<p>The pro-gambling camp claims that legalizing gambling would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the city. However, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that there would not be as many jobs created as claimed, and the amount of revenue generated would be minimal. In fact, legalizing gambling could actually lead to job losses as casinos tend to cannibalize other businesses such as restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are pros and cons to legalizing gambling in Boston, but at this point in time it seems that the ban will stay in place.</p>
<h1 id="Mayor-Announces-New-Gambling-Prohibitions-in-Boston"><a href="#Mayor-Announces-New-Gambling-Prohibitions-in-Boston" class="headerlink" title="Mayor Announces New Gambling Prohibitions in Boston"></a>Mayor Announces New Gambling Prohibitions in Boston</h1><p>Boston, MA - In a move designed to curb gambling addiction and keep people safe, Mayor Marty Walsh has announced new prohibitions on gambling in the city of Boston. The new rules, which take effect on January 1st, 2019, prohibit all forms of gambling within the city limits with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>“Boston is a great city with a lot to offer, but we also need to be responsible and protect our residents from the dangers of gambling addiction,” Mayor Walsh said in a statement. “These new rules will help us do that by prohibiting all forms of gambling in Boston except for those that are already legal. I hope this sends a clear message that gambling is not something we take lightly in the City of Boston.”</p>
<p>The new prohibitions apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and poker. However, exceptions are made for state-run lotteries and horseracing. Violators of the new prohibition will face fines of up to $1,000.</p>
<p>The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from residents and business owners in Boston. Some argue that the prohibition will negatively impact their businesses while others support the measure as a way to protect people from addiction.</p>
<p>Mayor Walsh has said that he is willing to listen to input from business owners and residents as the city moves forward with implementing these new rules.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Considers-Allowing-Gambling-Once-Again"><a href="#Boston-Considers-Allowing-Gambling-Once-Again" class="headerlink" title="Boston Considers Allowing Gambling Once Again"></a>Boston Considers Allowing Gambling Once Again</h1><p>In the city that is home to the world-renowned Fenway Park and numerous universities, there is a new debate brewing about gambling. Elected officials are considering whether to allow casinos in Boston, after a ban on the activity was lifted by the state legislature in 2011.</p>
<p>The debate in Boston comes as other cities and towns in Massachusetts have already welcomed casino development. MGM Resort International is building a $1 billion casino in downtown Springfield, while Wynn Resorts is planning to open a $2.4 billion casino in Everett next door to Boston.</p>
<p>Proponents of permitting casinos in Boston argue that the tax revenue and jobs generated by the industry would be a boon for the city. They note that many other cities and states around the country have seen economic growth as a result of gambling, and they argue that Boston could benefit in a similar way.</p>
<p>Opponents of casinos in Boston highlight the social costs associated with gambling addiction. They argue that casinos would create crime and traffic problems, and would lead to increased rates of problem gambling. They also express concern that casinos would take business away from existing businesses, such as restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>The debate in Boston is ongoing, but it is clear that there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. Given the potential benefits and costs associated with permitting casinos in Boston, it will be important for elected officials to carefully weigh all of the evidence before making a decision.</p>
