The five teams in the American League East division are the Baltimore Orioles, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Toronto Blue Jays.

#  Who are the favourites to win the American League East?

The American League East is always one of the most hotly contested divisions in baseball, and this year is no exception. The Toronto Blue Jays are the favourites to win the division, but the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees will all be vying for the top spot.

The Blue Jays made some big moves in the offseason, signing free agent outfielder Jose Bautista and catcher Russell Martin. They also traded for shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and starting pitcher David Price. These additions make Toronto a formidable team, and they are expected to win the division this year.

The Red Sox have made some changes as well, trading away veteran players such as Jon Lester and John Lackey. However, they still have a strong roster, led by sluggers David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia. The Orioles are a young team that is getting better each year, and they should be competitive this season. And the Yankees are always a threat, thanks to their wealth of talent and array of superstar players.

It should be an exciting season in the American League East, with all teams fighting for the top spot. The Blue Jays appear to be the frontrunners at this point, but it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the end.
