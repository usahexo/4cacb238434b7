#  Industry watchdog slams 'dirty tricks' by gambling firms 

A report by the industry watchdog has criticised gambling firms for using 'dirty tricks' to lure players into risking more money than they intended.

The Gambling Commission's review of how the industry operated in 2016 found that operators employed a variety of techniques which it described as 'sleazy and underhanded'.

These included misleading promotional offers, automatic bets which increased the size of a player's stake without their knowledge, and failing to warn customers about the risks of gambling.

In some cases, customers were even encouraged to borrow money in order to gamble larger sums.

The report warned that such methods could lead to financial and social harm, and called on operators to do more to protect consumers.

Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: "We are calling on operators to step up and take responsibility for protecting consumers from these harms. We want them to root out the dirty tricks used by some operators and make sure their promotions are fair and not misleading."

Gambling industry body The Association of British Bookmakers said it was committed to tackling problem gambling and would work with the commission to ensure its members complied with the rules.

#  Gambling companies face investigation over 'manipulative practices' 

The UK Gambling Commission has announced that it will be investigating several gambling companies over allegations of manipulative practices.

The investigation is said to be focusing on the use of ' incentives ' to encourage customers to gamble more, including free bets and bonus offers.

It is also looking at whether gambling firms are doing enough to protect vulnerable customers from addictive behaviour.

The commission's executive director, Tim Gibb, said: "We are concerned about the use of incentives by some operators, which may amount to manipulative practices."

He added that the commission would be "looking closely at the way these companies are operating and taking enforcement action as necessary."

The probe will include a review of the marketing strategies used by gambling firms, as well as their interactions with customers.

It is thought that the investigation could lead to enforcement action being taken against some of the companies involved.

#  MP calls for inquiry into 'shady' tactics by gambling firms 

The gambling industry has been rocked by fresh claims of wrongdoing, after an MP called for a parliamentary inquiry into the “shady” tactics used by firms.

Labour MP Carolyn Harris said that gambling companies were using “dodgy practices” to lure people into opening and toping up betting accounts.

She claimed that some firms were sending out text messages which appeared to be from friends or family members, asking recipients to participate in gambling activities.

In one case, a constituent of Ms Harris had received a text from her bank asking if she wanted to bet on the Champions League final. The message was not actually sent by the bank, but by a third party working on behalf of a betting company.

 Ms Harris said that such activities were exploiting people who were already struggling with addiction or debt problems.

“This is nothing less than daylight robbery of some of the most vulnerable people in our society,” she told Parliament. “We must put a stop to these shady practices and get to the bottom of what is going on.”

The Gambling Commission has announced that it will be investigating the allegations, while the Labour Party has also pledged to introduce new regulations if it comes to power at the next election.

#  Gambling companies profiting from addiction, says charity 

Gambling companies are making huge profits from addiction and should be doing more to help those affected, a leading charity has said.

Addaction claims that the gambling industry is worth £13.5 billion a year, but that just 2% of that goes towards helping people with gambling problems.

The charity is calling for a levy on gambling companies to fund help for addicts, as well as a change in the law to make it easier for addicts to get help.

It also wants the government to conduct an inquiry into the industry and its impact on addicts.

Addaction estimates that there are around 430,000 problem gamblers in the UK, many of whom are suffering in silence.

The charity's chief executive, Paul Hayes, said: "For too long, the gambling industry has got away with putting profits before people. It's time they stepped up and took responsibility for the damage their products cause."

Gambling companies have responded by saying that they are already doing a lot to help addicts.

A spokesperson for Bet 365 said: "We work closely with GambleAware to ensure we provide responsible gambling practices and our customers can access information and tools to gamble safely."

#  Casinos use of bots to rig games called out by industry experts

A growing number of casino industry experts are calling out casinos for using bots to rig games in their favor. These experts contend that the use of bots allows casinos to cheat customers out of millions of dollars each year.

The use of bots has long been a concern for casino players, who have wondered how casinos can seemingly always win. But concerns about casino bots escalated last month after a damning investigative report by STAT and The Globe and Mail revealed that Canadian online casino company PlayNow was using automated programs, or “bots”, to help it win more money from players.

According to the report, PlayNow was using at least two different types of bots. One bot would identify profitable betting patterns and then place subsequent bets on behalf of the casino; while a second bot would take control of player accounts and make unrealistic bets in an effort to lose as much money as possible.

In total, the investigation found that PlayNow had rigged the outcomes of over 4.5 million bets worth more than $22 million. While it is not clear how widespread the use of bots is among casinos, these revelations have raised concerns that similar practices could be happening at other casinos around the world.

Bot-rigging is not a new phenomenon in the gambling industry. A study published by Oxford University in 2016 found that up to £1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) per year was being lost to rigged online games. But this latest report shines a light on just how sophisticated casino bots have become, and the devastating impact they can have on players’ wallets.

So how can you protect yourself from being ripped off by casino bots? The simplest way is to avoid playing at online casinos altogether. If you do decide to play, be sure to research which casinos are reputable and have good track records for paying out players fairly. You can also look for independent verification seals such as eCOGRA or iTech Labs, which attest that a casino has been tested and certified as fair and safe.
