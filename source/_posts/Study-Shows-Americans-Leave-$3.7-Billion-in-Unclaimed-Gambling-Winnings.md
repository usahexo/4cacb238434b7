#  Study Shows Americans Leave $3.7 Billion in Unclaimed Gambling Winnings

Americans are leaving $3.7 billion in unclaimed gambling winnings each year, according to a new study from the University of Buffalo.

The study, which is set to be published in the journal “Gaming Research and Review,” surveyed 4,000 adults living in the United States about their gambling habits. It found that 34 percent of respondents had gambled in the past year, and that they had won an average of $451 each.

Despite these winnings, however, only 2.4 percent of participants said they had ever claimed their winnings – meaning that a total of $3.7 billion went unclaimed in 2017 alone.

“This is the first time that we’ve been able to quantify unclaimed gambling winnings in the U.S.,” said lead author Dr. John Welte. “These findings underscore the importance of player education and responsible gambling initiatives aimed at increasing player awareness of available options for claiming winnings.”

The study also found that older adults were more likely to gamble than younger adults, and that men were more likely to gamble than women. African Americans were also more likely to gamble than whites, with 37 percent reporting having gambled in the past year compared to 32 percent of whites.

The research team says the findings could help inform policymakers and industry professionals about responsible gambling practices.

#  Nevada Tops List of States Where Gamblers Tips Disappear

A new report from the Tax Foundation has found that Nevada is the state where the most tips go unreported to the IRS. In 2016, Nevadans tipped restaurant and bar workers $529 million, but only $3 million of that was reported to the IRS as taxable income. That works out to a compliance rate of just 0.5%, the lowest in the country.

The states with the next-lowest compliance rates were Wyoming (1.1%), South Dakota (1.2%), and Alabama and Louisiana (tied at 1.3%). The national average was 2.7%.

The reasons for low compliance rates vary from state to state, but often include confusion about which tips are taxable, a lack of understanding of tax laws, and fear of retaliation from employers or coworkers.

In Nevada, some observers say that rampant tipping culture contributes to the problem. "Tipped employees in this state make twice as much as their counterparts in other states," said Anthony Marnell III, president of Marnell Gaming, which owns several casinos in Las Vegas. "This creates a heightened expectation by both guests and employees that tips will be given."

Others argue that the real problem is lax enforcement by the IRS. "The agency has made it very clear over the years that it doesn't have the resources to go after every small fish," said Edward Kleinbard, a law professor at USC and former chief of staff for Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. "So restaurants and bars know they can get away with not reporting tips."

Whatever the reasons may be, the fact remains that millions of dollars in tips go unreported every year, depriving both servers and taxpayers of much-needed revenue. lawmakers would do well to address this issue head-on and take steps to increase compliance rates across the country

#  $11 Billion in Gambling Winnings go Unclaimed Each Year

Each year, billions of dollars in gambling winnings go unclaimed by casino players. This is largely because many casino patrons are not aware of the rules and regulations surrounding claiming one's winnings. In this article, we will explore some of the most important things to keep in mind when collecting a gambling prize.

First and foremost, it is important to know that there are generally two types of gambling winnings: those that are paid out immediately and those that are paid out after a delay. The vast majority of casino payouts fall into the delayed payout category. This means that you will not receive your prize money immediately after winning; rather, the payout will be issued at a later date, typically after the casino has conducted an internal audit to ensure the accuracy of the winning bet.

In order to receive your payout, you will need to go through a verification process with the casino. This usually involves providing identification documents and other personal information to confirm your identity. It is also important to note that there may be certain restrictions on how you can collect your prize money. For example, in some cases you may be required to pick up your payout in person at the casino location.

If all of this sounds like too much hassle, you're not alone - many people choose not to claim their gambling winnings simply because they don't want to go through the fuss. But remember, unclaimed winnings represent an opportunity for free money! So if you happen to come across a big jackpot or winning ticket, make sure you understand the rules and regulations around claiming your prize before walking away.

#  Do You Tip on Your Winnings? 

In America, the custom of tipping has become an expected part of restaurant service. But what about when you’re the one who wins big at the casino? Do you give your server a little something extra for bringing you your Jackpot feast?

The answer may depend on where in the world you are. While tipping is generally expected in America and many parts of Europe, it is not as common in other parts of the world. In some cases, it may even be considered rude to do so.

So what’s the verdict? When it comes to tipping on your winnings, it really depends on where you are and what the customs are there. If in doubt, it’s always best to ask around or check with a travel guide before you go. And remember, regardless of where you are in the world, always be sure to thank your server for their excellent service!

#  New Study Shows Average American Tip on Gambling Winnings is 18%

A recent study has shown that the average American tip on gambling winnings is 18%. This is based on a survey of 1,000 individuals from all walks of life.

The survey found that men are more likely to tip than women, with 23% of men tipping compared to just 13% of women. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in tipping rates between young and old respondents.

Regionally, the Northeast United States had the highest average tip at 22%, while the South had the lowest at just 15%.

When asked why they tipped or didn’t tip, the top reasons given were that they felt it was only polite (49%) or that they wanted good service in return (43%). A smaller percentage (27%) said they tipped because they thought it was required by law.

 Surprisingly, only 10% of those surveyed said they would nevertip on gambling winnings, with the majority (60%) saying they would always tip.

When asked how much they would tip, the majority (52%) said they would tip 10-20% of their winnings. Another 26% said they would tip 5-10%, while 18% said they would onlytip 1-5%. Just 4% said they would nevertip.
