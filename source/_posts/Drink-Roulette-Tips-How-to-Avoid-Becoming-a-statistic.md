#  Drink Roulette Tips: How to Avoid Becoming a statistic

We all know that drinking is a risky business. What might start out as innocent fun can quickly turn into a regretted mess. That’s why it’s important to take some precautions and have a plan before you start throwing back shots. Here are some tips for avoiding becoming a statistic when you drink:

1. Pace yourself.

Nobody ever regrets taking their time with a drink, but plenty of people regret rushing through them. Start slow and let your body adjust to the alcohol. This will help you avoid getting too drunk too fast, and will also help you stay in control later on.

2. alternate alcoholic drinks with water or soda.

This is another great way to pace yourself. Alcoholic drinks contain lots of sugar and carbs, which can quickly lead to a nasty hangover. By alternating alcoholic drinks with water or soda, you’ll help your body stay hydrated and avoid getting sick the next day.

3. Know your limits.

This is probably the most important tip of all. If you know your limits, you can better manage your drinking and avoid getting drunker than you intended to be. Figure out how many drinks you can have before feeling drunk, and stick to that number.

4. Avoid binge drinking.

Binge drinking is one of the biggest causes of alcohol-related deaths in the United States . If you don’t want to end up like one of those statistics, avoid binge drinking at all costs! A good rule of thumb is to never have more than four drinks in one night.

5. Have a plan for getting home safely .

This is especially important if you’re going to be partying hardy! Make sure you have a safe way home before you start drinking, whether that means having a designated driver or calling an Uber/Lyft. Otherwise, you could find yourself in some serious trouble if you try to drive while drunk.

#  How to Play Drink Roulette and Make Sure You Win

Drinking games can be a lot of fun, but there is always the risk that someone will end up getting too drunk. If you want to play a drinking game that is both fun and safe, try drink roulette.

The basic premise of drink roulette is very simple. You place a dice on a table, and everyone takes turns rolling it. Whoever rolls the highest number has to drink the corresponding number of shots. However, there are a few tips that you can follow to make sure that you always come out on top.

First of all, it is important to choose the right drinks for your game. Avoid spirits and opt for beers or ciders instead. This will help to keep things moving at a slower pace and reduce the risk of someone getting too drunk too quickly.

Another key thing to remember is to assign different colours to each player. This will help to avoid any arguments about who should drink what shots. Simply roll the dice and whoever gets the highest number has to drink the corresponding shot of their colour.

Finally, make sure that you have plenty of snacks and soft drinks on hand to help soak up any alcohol that gets consumed during the game. This will help keep everyone safe and healthy throughout the evening.

So why not give drink roulette a try this weekend? It’s a great way to get together with friends and have some fun without risking anyone getting too drunk.
