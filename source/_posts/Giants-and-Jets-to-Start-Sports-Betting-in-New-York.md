#  Giants and Jets to Start Sports Betting in New York

The New York Giants and Jets will start taking sports bets at their home stadiums this fall, as lawmakers in the state agreed to a new gambling bill.

Under the legislation, the two NFL teams will be able to offer in-stadium betting on football, basketball, hockey, and other sports. The casinos authorized to operate in the state will also be able to offer sports betting, although they will not be able to do so at their physical locations.

The 42 casinos that have applied for licenses will be able to offer mobile and online sports betting as well. Bettors will have to be physically located in New York in order to place a bet.

Governor Andrew Cuomo praised the agreement, which he said would provide millions of dollars in revenue to the state. He added that the new law would also protect consumers and create jobs.

"With this agreement we are positioning New York state for a major economic windfall," Cuomo said. "By harnessing this industry we can protect New Yorkers and bring jobs and entertainment options into our local communities."

According to Reuters, it is estimated that the new law could generate up to $700 million annually for New York State. This money would be used to fund education initiatives and other programs.

#  Nevada Gaming Officials Approve Sports Betting Plan

After a long meeting on Thursday, Nevada Gaming Control Board officials approved the state's first foray into legalized sports betting.

The plan, put forth by gambling mogul Steve Wynn, calls for a centralized system that would handle all bets placed on sporting events in the state.

Under the proposal, only casinos in Las Vegas would be allowed to offer sports betting, and customers would be limited to placing wagers on games occurring in the state of Nevada.

"We believe this proposed structure will allow us to effectively manage sports betting in Nevada and protect the interests of our licensees and gaming patrons," said board chairman A.G. Burnett in a statement announcing the decision.

The move comes as no surprise; Wynn has been lobbying hard for legalization of sports betting in Nevada since last year's US Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice.

While other states have since moved to legalize sports betting, Nevada is seen as a key market due to its large concentration of casinos and high volume of tourism traffic.

#  Delaware First State to Offer Full-Scale Sports Betting 

On Tuesday, June 5, Delaware became the first state to offer full-scale sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May. 

This new development opens up opportunities for more widespread gambling in the US. The case, Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. This law prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling, except for a few specific instances. 

Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, which found that the law violated the Tenth Amendment by commandeering states to keep their bans on sports betting in place. In other words, this law restricted states’ abilities to regulate an activity within their own borders. 

Delaware has been gearing up for this day for some time; it already has a well-established lottery system. Officials estimate that there is now potential for $9 million in annual revenue from sports betting in Delaware. That number is likely to grow as other states jump on the bandwagon. 

Nevada was the only state to offer full-scale sports betting before this decision, and its revenues from such bets have been dropping in recent years as other forms of gambling have become more popular. It will be interesting to see if other states can replicate Nevada’s success and if Delaware’s model proves to be more successful than Nevada’s. 

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was passed in response to concerns about match-fixing and corruption in professional sports. The legislators who wrote that bill probably didn’t foresee a future where people could bet on college games or amateur sporting events. It will be interesting to see how legislators deal with this new form of gambling and whether they try to rein it in or allow it to flourish.

#  West Virginia Opens Up Sports Betting, First State Outside Nevada, Delaware

West Virginia became the third state in the US to offer sports betting after Delaware and Nevada. The addition of West Virginia allows for legal sports betting outside of Nevada, home of Las Vegas.

Applications for licenses opened up on August 1st with the first bets being placed shortly thereafter. Bettors can now make wagers at four casinos in the state, with more likely to come online in the near future.

The addition of West Virginia is a big win for those who are in favor of legalized and regulated sports betting. This move could pave the way for other states to follow suit, especially now that there is some real-world experience with how it can be implemented.

There are still some hurdles that need to be cleared before full-scale sports betting can take place, but things are looking positive for the industry as a whole. With more states getting on board, it won't be long until sports betting is a mainstream activity across the United States.

#  How Does a New Sports Betting Line Work?

Sports betting is a big business, and it's only getting bigger. The industry is on track to reach $60 billion in bets by 2020. That's a lot of money changing hands, and a lot of potential profits for bookmakers.

For the casual sports fan, the world of sports betting can be a confusing one. There are all sorts of different bet types and options available, and it can be hard to know where to start.

In this article, we're going to explain how a new sports betting line works. We'll provide an overview of the most common bet types, and explain how odds are calculated. By the end of this article, you'll have a basic understanding of how to place a sports bet.

So, let's get started!

# The Basics

If you're new to sports betting, the first thing you need to understand is that there are two main types of bets: straight bets and parlays.

A straight bet is simply when you wager on one outcome only. For example, you might bet $10 that the New York Yankees will win their game against the Boston Red Sox. If they do win, you would collect $20 (your original stake plus the winnings). If they lose, you would lose your $10 stake.

A parlay is when you combine two or more bets into one single wager. For example, you might bet $10 on the Yankees to win and $10 on the Los Angeles Lakers to win their game that night. If both teams win, you would collect $240 (your original stake plus the winnings). If either team loses, you would lose your entire wager.

# The Odds

When it comes to sports betting, odds are everything. Odds tell you how likely or unlikely a particular outcome is, and they play a key role in determining how much money you can make (or lose) on a particular bet.

There are three main types of odds: fractional odds, decimal odds, and American odds. In this article, we'll be using decimal odds for simplicity's sake. However, all three types of odds work in essentially the same way.

Odds can also be expressed in terms of profit margins. This simply means that for every dollar wagered on an outcome, the bookmaker will take a cut (typically around 10%). So if an outcome has decimal odds of 2.0 (i.e., it's even money), then the bookmaker will take $10 in commission for every $100 wagered on that outcome (assuming no other costs are involved).


Now that we've covered the basics, let's take a closer look at how sports betting lines work!
