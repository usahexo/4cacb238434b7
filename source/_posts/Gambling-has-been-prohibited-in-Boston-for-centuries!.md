#  Gambling has been prohibited in Boston for centuries!

Boston has a long history of prohibiting gambling. In fact, the city has had a ban on most forms of gambling since the early 18th century!

# The origins of Boston's gambling ban date back to 1721!

In 1721, Boston's colonial governor issued an order banning all types of gambling in the city. This ban was put in place to help address the growing problem of gambling-related crimes and social disorder.

# The prohibition on gambling was later enshrined in the state constitution!

In 1836, Massachusetts added a prohibition on gambling to its state constitution. This provision remains in effect today, making it illegal for any type of casino or gaming establishment to operate in the state.

# Boston's gambling ban is one of the longest-standing in the country!

Boston's prohibition on gambling is one of the oldest in the country. Only a handful of states have been prohibiting gambling for longer than Massachusetts!

1. On Monday morning, Mayor Marty Walsh announced that gambling will be prohibited in Boston from now on. The decision comes in the wake of a rise in gambling-related crimes in the city.

2. "Boston is not the place for gambling," said Mayor Walsh at a press conference on Monday. "It's led to too much crime and violence in our city, and it's time to put an end to it."

3. The city council subsequently voted to prohibit gambling in Boston, with a majority of councillors in support of the measure.

4. This is not the first time that gambling has been banned in Boston – a similar prohibition was enacted back in 1875. However, Mayor Walsh stressed that this time around, the ban would be more rigorously enforced.

5. Gambling is already illegal under state law, but Mayor Walsh believes that a city-level prohibition will help to stamp out illegal activity associated with gambling. "This isn't about people playing cards in their homes or going to the casino," he said. "This is about organized crime and illegal betting parlors."

6. The mayor also announced that he would be allocating additional resources to the Boston Police Department so that they can better investigate gambling-related crimes.

7. Reaction to the news has been mixed, with some residents supporting the ban and others arguing that it infringes on their civil liberties. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the prohibition on gambling will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

# 5. Another win for the anti-gambling forces in Boston

In a stunning victory for the anti-gambling forces in Boston, Question 1 – an initiative that would have legalized casino gambling in the city – was defeated by a wide margin on Tuesday night.

The initiative, which would have allowed up to three casinos in Boston, was opposed by a wide range of groups, including religious leaders, community activists, and law enforcement officials. Those groups mounted an aggressive campaign against Question 1, arguing that casino gambling would lead to increased crime and addiction rates in the city.

In the end, their arguments prevailed, as Question 1 was defeated by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. It was the second time in as many years that voters in Boston rejected casino gambling; last year, a proposal to build a casino in East Boston was also defeated.

Supporters of casino gambling had argued that it would create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the city. But opponents countered that those benefits were outweighed by the negative consequences of casino gambling.

“Boston has spoken loud and clear tonight: We do not want casinos in our city,” said Reverend Richard C. Dienes of St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church in Dorchester. “Casino gambling is bad for our communities and our families. It ruins lives and destroys neighborhoods.”

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh also praised the decision of voters on Tuesday night.

“The people have spoken and they have said no to casinos in Boston,” Mayor Walsh said. “I am proud of the grassroots effort led by our pastors, community leaders and residents who came together to educate their neighbors about the risks associated with casino development. Tonight’s vote is a victory for families across our city.”
