#   College students addicted to gambling face greater risk of developing problem

A study of college students found that those who are addicted to gambling are more likely to develop a problem with gambling. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia, looked at the gambling habits of 603 students.

The study found that 18 percent of the students were addicted to gambling, and that these students were more than twice as likely to develop a problem with gambling as those who were not addicted to gambling.

The study also found that those who were addicted to gambling were more likely to have lower grades and higher levels of anxiety and depression.

“This is the first study to show that addiction to gambling among college students is associated with worse mental health outcomes,” said Andree-Anne Fournier, lead author of the study.

Fournier said the findings suggest that student addiction to gambling should be treated as a public health issue.

“Addiction to gambling is a serious problem and it is important to recognize it early on so that appropriate interventions can be put in place,” she said.

#   Casino gambling could lead to addictive behavior in college students

Casino gambling could lead to addictive behavior in college students, new research suggests.

The study, which is published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, found that over one-in-four college students who gambled in a casino reported symptoms of addiction within the previous year.

“We were surprised at how many students met criteria for addiction,” said study author Dr. Joseph Guiliano.

For the study, researchers analyzed data from nearly 4,000 college students who had gambled in a casino at least once in the past year. They found that 26 percent of participants reported symptoms of addiction, including thoughts about gambling more than intended, unsuccessful attempts to cut back on gambling, and cravings for gambling.

Men were more likely to report symptoms of addiction than women, and students who lived on campus were more likely to report symptoms of addiction than those who lived off campus.

The findings suggest that casino gambling could lead to addictive behavior in some college students, which could have serious consequences for their academic and personal lives.

“It is important for universities to be aware of these risks so they can provide prevention and treatment services for their students who might be affected,” said Dr. Guiliano.

#   Gambling addiction on the rise among college students

A recent study conducted by the University of Nevada has shown that gambling addiction is on the rise among college students. The study found that one in four college students have developed a problem with gambling, and that this number is only going to continue to grow in the years to come.

What is causing this alarming trend? There are many possible explanations. One could be that easy access to gambling has made it more available and attractive to young people. With online casinos and sports betting becoming more popular, it’s easier than ever for college students to gamble away their money without even leaving campus.

Another explanation could be that many college students are struggling with anxiety and depression, and they turn to gambling as a way to cope. Gambling can provide a temporary high that can make people feel good for a while, but it’s ultimately just a Band-Aid solution that doesn’t solve the underlying problem.

Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that gambling addiction is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. If you know someone who might be struggling with a gambling addiction, please urge them to get help. There are many resources available for people who want to get sober from gambling, and with proper treatment and support, they can overcome this addiction and get their life back on track.

#  Casinos popular among college students, but come with risks

Casinos have always been popular among adults, but in recent years they have become increasingly popular among college students. It’s easy to see why – casinos offer a wide variety of games, great food, and atmosphere. But what is often overlooked is the fact that casinos come with risks.

The biggest risk when it comes to casinos is gambling addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about 2 million Americans are addicted to gambling. This means that they can’t resist the urge to gamble, no matter what the consequences may be. casino-gambling-addiction

Gambling addiction can ruin lives. It can lead to financial ruin, relationships being ruined, and even criminal activity. So before you decide to go to a casino, make sure you understand the risks involved and are prepared for them.

Another risk associated with casinos is theft. Casinos are often targets for thieves because there are a lot of people carrying a lot of money around. There have been cases of people being robbed or even assaulted while in casinos. So again, be aware of the risks and take precautions if necessary.

Overall, casinos can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to be aware of the risks involved before you go. If you’re able to manage those risks, then enjoy yourself – but if you’re not comfortable with them, then it might be best to stay away.

#  Problem gambling plagues college campuses across the country

Problem gambling is a growing concern on college campuses across the United States. A recent study by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) found that nearly one in five college students (19 percent) meets the diagnostic criteria for problem gambling. This is a significant increase from previous studies, which found that just 5-8 percent of students met the criteria.

The study also found that male students are more likely to gamble than female students, and that gambling increases as students get older. Previous research has shown that problem gambling can lead to academic problems, financial difficulties, and addiction problems.

What can be done to address this growing problem? The NCPG recommends that colleges and universities develop prevention and intervention programs for students who are at risk for problem gambling. These programs should include educational components about the risks associated with gambling, as well as counseling and support services for students who need help.

It is also important to raise awareness about problem gambling among campus communities. Students, faculty, and staff should all be aware of the warning signs of problem gambling and know where they can go for help if needed.

Addressing the issue of problem gambling on college campuses is an important step in preventing these students from experiencing negative consequences associated with gambling addiction.
